# The Adventures of Buff Frog

This is my OOP assignment. It's a 2D dungeon game where you move around a shirtless sword-wielding frog. üê∏

The university Git repository was deleted a long time ago but I was lucky to have a downloaded copy. I've cleaned up and restructured the code in this repository.

## Requirements

- Java 21.0.4
- Maven 3.9.9
- JavaFX SDK 21.0.2

## Setup

```sh
mvn clean package

java --module-path $JAVA_FX_PATH/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar target/dungeon-1.0.jar
```

## Disclaimer

Most of the assets used in this game were found on the internet. Credit goes to the original creators.
